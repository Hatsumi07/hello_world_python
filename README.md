# Overview

- With this piece of software I intend to further my learning of and practice with the Python programming language. 


- The program contains a statement to display in the console a hello world message and it also has a variable to store the value of an input. The variable name is assigned the value of the input inserted through the terminal by the user. The variable name is later used to print a customized message to the console.


- This program was made to learn the basics of the Python programming language.

- I used Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE) and an extension of Python.
